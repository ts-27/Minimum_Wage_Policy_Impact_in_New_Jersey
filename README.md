# Minimum_Wage_Policy_Impact_in_New_Jersey

This project presents a Python regression model based on the landmark New Jerseyâ€“Pennsylvania minimum wage case study by David Card and Alan Krueger (1994). The study examined the effect of a minimum wage increase in New Jersey from $4.25 to $5.05 per hour, while neighboring Pennsylvania kept its rate unchanged at $4.25.

To measure the impact, Card and Krueger collected data from fast-food restaurants in both states, comparing employment levels before and after the policy change. Contrary to the traditional economic view that higher minimum wages reduce employment, their results showed that employment in New Jersey did not fall and in some cases even increased relative to Pennsylvania.

Building on this case, I developed my own analysis in Python, where I:
1. Constructed three different regression models to capture the relationship between minimum wage changes and employment levels.
2. Created a visualization to highlight employment trends across New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
3. Used Python libraries such as pandas, statsmodels, and matplotlib to implement the models and generate outputs.
